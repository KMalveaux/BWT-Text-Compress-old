<h1>Java based Burrows-Wheeler Transform Elias-Gamma encoded text compressor</h1>
<p>This was an advanced honors project I completed during my data structures and algorithms course during my 2nd year of college.
<br> I will likely redo this project one day with an enhanced skill set and greater tooling knowledge as it greatly interested me.</p>
<p>To run, place text into the file called "inputFile.txt" located in the base directory. If this file is not present, create it and add text.
<br>The compile the Java file and execute it to run the compression algorithm.</p>
